h1. This is copypasta

Copypasta is a straightforward way to implement for loops in text files. For example,

<pre>
#{for x in [["happy", "clap", "hands"], ["angry", "stomp", "feet"]]}
If you're #{x[0]} and you know it #{x[1]} your #{x[2]}!
If you're #{x[0]} and you know it #{x[1]} your #{x[2]}!
If you're #{x[0]} and you know it then you surely want to show it
If you're #{x[0]} and you know it #{x[1]} your #{x[2]}.
#{end}
</pre>

becomes:

<pre>

If you're happy and you know it clap your hands!
If you're happy and you know it clap your hands!
If you're happy and you know it then you surely want to show it
If you're happy and you know it clap your hands.

If you're angry and you know it stomp your feet!
If you're angry and you know it stomp your feet!
If you're angry and you know it then you surely want to show it
If you're angry and you know it stomp your feet.
</pre>

The leading blank line results from the newline after the for block.

Call with:

<pre>
$ ./copypasta.py clap-your-hands.txt.cp
</pre>

h2. Syntax

Inside the <tt>for</tt> block, the values are interpreted as JSON. When you refer to variables, such as <tt>#{x}</tt>, Python syntax is required.
