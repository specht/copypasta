h1. This is copypasta

Copypasta is a straightforward way to implement for loops in text files. For example,

<pre>
#{for i in range(5)}
#{i + 1}, check!
#{end}
</pre>

becomes:

<pre>

1, check!

2, check!

3, check!

4, check!

5, check!
</pre>

The leading blank line results from the newline after the for block.

Call with:

<pre>
$ ./copypasta.py test-range.txt.cp
</pre>

h2. Syntax

You can start a for loop with @for [key] in [values]@ where values should be something which is iterable in Python, such as a list or a range. Every @for@ statement must be matched with an @end@ statement.
